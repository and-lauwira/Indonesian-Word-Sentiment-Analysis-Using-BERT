# Indonesian-Word-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-BERT
This project is a demonstration of using BERT for sentiment analysis on text data. It uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on a dataset of movie reviews.

#Requirements#
To run this project, you will need:
•	Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures for efficiently storing and querying large datasets and includes functions for reading and writing data to various file formats.

•	Transformers: A library developed by Hugging Face that provides pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis.

•	PyTorch: An open-source machine learning library that provides tools for building and training neural networks. It's used in this code to train the sentiment analysis model.

•	NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python. It provides tools for working with arrays and matrices and includes functions for performing various mathematical operations.

•	Scikit-learn: A library for machine learning in Python. It provides tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation, among other things.

•	tqdm: A library for creating progress bars in Python. It's used in this code to display a progress bar during training.

•	Sastrawi: A library for Indonesian text preprocessing. It includes tools for removing stop words, stemming, and other tasks specific to Indonesian language processing.
